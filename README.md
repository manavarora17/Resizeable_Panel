Resizable Panels Layout with React and API Integration
This project combines a resizable panels layout created with React and the react-resizable-panels package, along with API integration to add/edit data within the components. The layout consists of three distinct components with resizable functionality, and users can perform CRUD operations through the provided APIs.

Features
Resizable Panels: Users can resize the components by dragging them from any side, with neighboring components expanding or shrinking accordingly.
API Integration: Provides APIs for adding and editing data in the components, with functionality to add new entries or update existing ones.
Count Endpoint: Includes an API endpoint to retrieve the count of times the add and update APIs have been called.
